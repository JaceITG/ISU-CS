Participation #3

Make images of your notes for lesson 4 (Registers, Memory layout, System calls
and NASM)

http://cs.indstate.edu/~sbaker/cs351/lesson.php?lesson=lesson4

make them into a pdf as notes.pdf and hand them in by the due-date.

If you wish to submit images that will work fine as well.  Add the images
to the directory and run the command (while in the p4 directory):

find . > manifest

That will populate the manifest file which will then let you handin
all the files in the directory.

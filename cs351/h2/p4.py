# Make a program to divide two integers a by b in binary.  You may only use
# the bitwise operations &, |, ^, <<, >> and addition and subtraction. The
# program should print the result as well as the amount remaining after
# division.
# Hint: Don't try to divide negative numbers, convert them to positives and
# keep track of how many were negative and if only one was, convert the result
# to negative.
# 
# Example input/output:
# ./p4 42 5
# 8 R 2

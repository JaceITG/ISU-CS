1. Yes, I have a stable living situation with my parents in California.
2. Yes, I have good enough internet to stream video, make larger downloads, and do anything that might be required for online learning.
3. My laptop broke, but I'll be able to use my desktop at home to complete everything.
4. There aren't any confirmed cases that I know of within my town, and there most likely won't be any health impacts on my studies since everyone I am living with is pretty well isolated from infection risks.
